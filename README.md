# Nonlinear Automatic Control of an Actuated Mechanical System

This project focuses on modeling and control design for a nonlinear mechanical system with variable inertia, friction, and stiffness. The work includes:

- Derivation of the nonlinear state-space model
- Linearization around the equilibrium point
- Controller design meeting performance and robustness specs
- Validation on both the linearized and nonlinear models using Simulink

Developed in MATLAB and Simulink as part of the "Automatic Control" course at the University of Bologna.
